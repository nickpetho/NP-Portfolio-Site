# Nick Petho's Online Portfolio

Hi! Thanks for checking out my portfolio website. It has two versions available to view, "Simple" and "Full". I decided to make two versions because I wanted to
demonstrate my design and coding abilities but also wanted to make it as quick as possible for potential employers/clients to look over and get important information.
I felt that this "dual-site" design was the best fit.

## Full Version

The "Full" version of the site is based on different operating system UIs. The landing page and the Home page for the "Full" version are based on Windows 10.
The Projects page is based on Mac's Catalina design. The Skills page is based on a Linux Ubuntu design. Next, the Experience page looks like the classic Windows XP
desktop with the iconic green hill and blue sky. One of my favorite's is the Education page which is based on the retro Windows 95 look. And finally the About Me
page is based on a modern classic, Windows 7.

## Simple Version

The "Simple" version of the site is a single, scrollable page with a toolbar on the side to allow for jumping to specfic sections. It contains all the same information and
demo funcationality as the "Full" version just in a simpler and easier to navigate design.

## Credits

This site was made using React.js along with Tailwind.css to give it it's responsive design. And thanks to my good friend Matt Luonuansuu for designing my person logo as well.
